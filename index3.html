                        <p>Hi! I'm Marcus, a full-time student at Singapore Polytechnic. I'm passionate about environmental sustainability and have embraced a low-waste lifestyle.</p>

                        <p>I enjoy travelling around the world and learning cultures and backgrounds from different countries.</p>

                        <p>As someone who enjoys expressing myself through art, I've found creative green hacks that let me reduce waste while staying true to my artistic side. For example, I often reuse packaging materials, old receipts, and scraps of paper in my junk journaling projects 
                        instead of buying new art supplies. While I also enjoy digital art on my iPad for its convenience and versatility, I find that working with the traditional method such as using paper adds a unique, tactile quality to my creations especially when painting. The textures, layering, and depth achievable with physical materials 
                        often create a more three-dimensional effect, which looks beautiful when framed. This blend of reusing materials and choosing the right medium for the right purpose allows me to express myself while staying mindful of the environment.</p>
