                <h2>What are my zero-waste goals?</h2>
                <article class="grid-container">
                    <p>I've always been passionate about protecting the environment and finding ways to live more sustainably. My journey into eco-friendly living began when I became aware of how much everyday waste ends up in landfills. 
                    Since then, I've started adopting low-waste habits like carrying reusable bags and water bottles and refusing plastic straws.
                    I like to repurpose old clothes into cleaning rags which saves money and gives fabric a second life. I have also started composting my food scraps at home, or cooking just enough for myself and my family,
                    which has significantly reduced the amount of garbage I throw away.</p>
                    <p>I enjoy junk journaling, which is a creative and sustainable way to repurpose everyday waste materials like plastic wrappers, paper packaging, old tickets, and receipts. Instead of throwing them away, I collect these items and use them to make unique, artistic journal pages. Each journal entry is highly personalized, 
                    often reflecting my thoughts, memories, or feelings at that moment. This process not only allows me to express myself through art and storytelling, but also gives a second life to materials that would otherwise contribute to landfill waste. Junk journaling has become a meaningful way for me to combine creativity with eco-conscious living, and every finished page reminds me that beauty can be found in what others might consider trash.</p>
                    <p>As someone who deeply appreciates nature, it brings me a sense of fulfillment and purpose to know that the waste I produce is being transformed into something beneficial. Through composting my food scraps and other biodegradable materials, Iâ€™m able to turn what would otherwise be garbage into rich, fertile soil that nourishes plants and gardens. This simple act not only reduces the amount of waste I send to landfills, 
                    but also supports the natural cycle of life. Knowing that my choices are helping the environment rather than harming it makes me feel more connected to the earth and reinforces my commitment to live sustainably.</p>

                        <strong>How I overcome it and challenges I have faced.</strong>
                        <p>One of the main challenges I faced was forgetting to bring my reusable bags when I went shopping, especially during unplanned store visits. I also felt a bit awkward refusing plastic bags at the checkout counter when I didn't have an alternative with me. 
                            To overcome this, I made it a habit to keep reusable bags in my backpack so they were always within reach. Over time, this small change became part of my routine, making it easier to stick to my goal and reduce plastic waste.</p>
