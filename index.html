                <h2>The 5 principles of zero-waste</h2>
                <p>Refuse, Reduce, Reuse, Recycle & Compost.</p>
                <p>These are the principles to help reduce waste and protect the environment,</p>
                <ul class="principles">
                    <li> 
                        <strong>Refusing</strong>
                        <p>Say no to things you don't need, such as single-use plastics, freebies, and promotional items that create unnecessary waste. This helps stop waste before it starts. It reduces pollution, saves natural resources, and lowers demand for harmful products. By saying no to what you don't need, you also avoid cluttering, making more mindful choices, and set a positive example for others.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Reducing</strong>
                        <p>Use less and buy only what you truly need. Reducing helps minimize waste, lowers your environmental impact, and encourages buying only what adds real value to your life.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Reusing</strong>
                        <p>Choose items that can be used again, such as containers or cloth bags. You should use items again instead of throwing them away. Reusing extends the life of products, cuts down on single-use items, and saves money and materials.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Recycling</strong>
                        <p>Properly sort and recycle materials that can be processed into new products. It can help turn old materials into new ones, reduces landfill waste, and supports the economy.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Composting</strong>
                        <p>Compost food scraps and biodegradable waste instead of sending them to landfill. We will reduce methane emissions from landfills, enriching soil and turn organic waste into valuable resources when we compost our food.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    <p>The average person produced about 1,500kg of solid waste per year, and landfills are filling up and we are running out of space.</p>

                    <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>In Kamikatsu, Japan, they have declared a zero-waste goal in 2003 and now reuses, recycles, or composts over 80% of its waste. Residents sort waste into 45 categories, clean items before recycling, and reduce waste through local programs like cloth diaper distribution and a swap shop for sharing items.</p></li>
                    <li>
                        <p>In Taiwan, they achieved a 99% landfill diversion rate, with over 50% recycling and 75% of food waste reused for animal feed and composting. Though around 40% of waste is still incinerated, Taiwan has made major progress since adopting zero-waste policies in 2003, driven by public pressure to stop building more incinerators.</p></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Key takeaway:</strong> Zero-waste living is about making mindful daily choices, every small action adds up, and everyone can do their part to work towards a zero-waste lifestyle for Mother Earth!</p>
